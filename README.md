# How is the skiing in December?

## Description
The month of December in Washington State can often be a fickle time with respect to accumulating enough snow for commercial ski operations to get into full swing, and be able to capitalize on the peak holiday season to generate revenue.  Seasoned veterans of the Pacific Northwest skiing community may even be heard grumbling that "it's hardly worth buying lift tickets in advance during the month of December because the conditions are so variable that sometimes it feels like it rains as much as it snows", or "it just doesn't snow enough to open a reasonable amount of terrain before the big storms arrive in January or later".  This project explores archived weather data from one of the most popular ski areas in close proximity to Seattle and Western Washington, Alpental at Snoqualmie Pass, to get a better picture of how the winter weather shapes things for that specific venue over a five year period.
