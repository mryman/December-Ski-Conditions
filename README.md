# How is the skiing in December?

## Description
The month of December in Washington State can often be a fickle time with respect to accumulating enough snow for commercial ski operations to get into full swing, and be able to capitalize on the peak holiday season to generate revenue.  This project explores archived weather data from one of the most popular ski areas in close proximity to Seattle and Western Washington, Alpental at Snoqualmie Pass.
